In this repo, you will find the following files:
1. planning.ipynb
    This jupyter file starts with an overview of my planned approach to the assignment
    The file also shows a written flowchart to how the code should run, following each line to the end\
    This file also has some troubleshooting and site retrieval work.
2. .gitignore
    This file is here in place of my config.py
    My config.py contains sensitive property: my API key for the WeatherAPI
    Please reach out to me if you are in need of my config.py file
    If you have your own API key for http://api.openweathermap.org, save your key under the variable APIKey and you should be fine!
    If using my API key, for this code to run, you must have config.py in the same directorary.
3. holidays.json
    This file was given to us to start with. Contains 7 holidays from 2021 in json format.
    These 7 holidays, along with the holidays from https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ 2020-2024, are prepopulated.
    For this code to run, you must have holidays.json in the same directorary.
4. holidaymanager.py
    This is the meat and potatoes!
    There is no prerequisite setup other than having the holidays.json and config.py/APIKey variable ready as described earlier.
    Please note that if you choose to Save Changes, it will populate a JSON file in the same directory.
